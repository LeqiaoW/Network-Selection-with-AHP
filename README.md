Network Selection in Vertical Handover with Analytical Hierarchy Process
==========================

A java implementation,in both command-line and Graphical User Interface Mode,
to rank the available networks during Vertical Handover using AHP(Analytic hierarchy process), based on user parameters.

AHP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process

Vertical Handover: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_handover

Procedure:

The user 1st specifies which quality of service class she would prefer. There are four classes - 
a) Conversational 
b) Streaming
c) Interactive
d) Background

Next, the parameters of the available networks are obtained. In this project, it is user-input, although 
in a real world scenario, it will be different.
